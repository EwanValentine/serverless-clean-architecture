# Clean Architected Serverless

## Note:
This isn't a complete, working repo, just an outline. The serverless projects aren't hooked up etc.

## Benefits
- Business logic is re-usable
- Execution is decoupled from the business logic
- Datalayer is decoupled
- Business logic is core, everything else is a detail
- Easier to test
